# Teacher Staff Remuneration System

## Overview

The Teacher Staff Remuneration System is designed to automate the manual process of remunerating teachers at Shahjalal University of Science and Technology. Traditionally, the process involves maintaining handwritten ledgers, which is prone to inefficiencies, errors, and delays. This project aims to streamline the remuneration process by digitizing the entire workflow, from the formation of exam committees to the generation of payment invoices.

The system is built to enhance accuracy, transparency, and efficiency, ensuring that all stakeholders—administrators, directors, chairpersons, and teachers—can manage and track payments seamlessly. By implementing role-based access, the system ensures that each user has the appropriate permissions, improving security and organization.

## Scope
